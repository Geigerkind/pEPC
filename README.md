# pEPC  
Priest EP Calculator  
Provides a EP estimation for each item you hover over.  
  
I made this for myself in order to play a little on Netherwing, but guess other people can use it as well.  
  
Note: Only works for Shadow priests. Feel free to fork it and change it for your class  
Note: It assumes for sockets 9 EP (9 Spell power gem)  
Note: It does not consider enchants, socket bonus or current gems.
